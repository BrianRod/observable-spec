# Observable

**An open standard for sound, interoperable JavaScript Observables.**

An *Observable* is an object that can send multiple values to a consumer.  An Observable has two methods, `observer` and `forEach`, which each accept a generator and send it any number of values.

This specification details the behavior of the `subscribe` and `observer` methods, providing an interoperable base which all conformant Observable implementations can be depended on to provide. As such, the specification should be considered very stable. Although the Observable organization may occasionally revise this specification with minor backward-compatible changes to address newly-discovered corner cases, we will integrate large or backward-incompatible only after careful consideration, discussion, and testing.

The core Observable specification does not deal with how to create Observables, Generators, or Subscriptions, choosing instead to focus on providing an interoperable `subscribe` and `observer` methods. Future work in companion specifications may touch on these subjects.

## Terminology

1. "observable" is an object or function with a `subscribe` method and `observer` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.
1. "subscribable" is an object or function that defines a `subscribe` method and an `observer` method.

## Requirements

### The `subscribe` Method

A promise must provide a `subscribe` method to allow access its values.

A promise's `subscribe` method accepts one argument and returns one value:

```js
var subscription = observable.subscribe(generator);
```

1. The generator is a required argument.
    1. It must be an object.
1. If generator is an object with a `throw` method.
    1. it may optionally return an IterationResult when called.
    1. it must be called if an error is thrown anywhere in code either executed synchronously or asynchronously by observable.
    1. it must not be called after the generator's `return` method.
    1. it must not be called more than once.
    1. it must be called after `dispose` method on the subscription generated by the call to `subscribe.`
    1. it must not be called after the generator's `next` method returns an IterationResult with a done value of true.
1. If generator is an object with a `return` method.
    1. it must be called if an error is thrown anywhere in code either executed synchronously or asynchronously by observable.
    1. it must not be called after the generator's `throw` method.
    1. it must not be called more than once.
    1. it must be called after `dispose` method on the subscription generated by the call to `subscribe.`
    1. it must not be called after the generator's `next` method returns an IterationResult with a done value of true.
1. If generator is an object with a `return` method.
    1. observable must call it if an error is thrown anywhere in code executed directly or indirectly by observable.
    1. it must not be called after the generator's `return` method.
    1. it must not be called more than once.
    1. it must be called after `dispose` method on the subscription generated by the call to `subscribe.`
1. `onFulfilled` or `onRejected` must not be called until the [execution context](https://es5.github.io/#x10.3) stack contains only platform code. [[3.1](#notes)].
1. `onFulfilled` and `onRejected` must be called as functions (i.e. with no `this` value). [[3.2](#notes)]
1. `then` may be called multiple times on the same promise.
    1. If/when `promise` is fulfilled, all respective `onFulfilled` callbacks must execute in the order of their originating calls to `then`.
    1. If/when `promise` is rejected, all respective `onRejected` callbacks must execute in the order of their originating calls to `then`.
1. `then` must return a promise [[3.3](#notes)].

    ```js
    promise2 = promise1.then(onFulfilled, onRejected);
    ```

    1. If either `onFulfilled` or `onRejected` returns a value `x`, run the Promise Resolution Procedure `[[Resolve]](promise2, x)`.
    1. If either `onFulfilled` or `onRejected` throws an exception `e`, `promise2` must be rejected with `e` as the reason.
    1. If `onFulfilled` is not a function and `promise1` is fulfilled, `promise2` must be fulfilled with the same value as `promise1`.
    1. If `onRejected` is not a function and `promise1` is rejected, `promise2` must be rejected with the same reason as `promise1`.

### The Promise Resolution Procedure

The **promise resolution procedure** is an abstract operation taking as input a promise and a value, which we denote as `[[Resolve]](promise, x)`. If `x` is a thenable, it attempts to make `promise` adopt the state of `x`, under the assumption that `x` behaves at least somewhat like a promise. Otherwise, it fulfills `promise` with the value `x`.

This treatment of thenables allows promise implementations to interoperate, as long as they expose a Promises/A+-compliant `then` method. It also allows Promises/A+ implementations to "assimilate" nonconformant implementations with reasonable `then` methods.

To run `[[Resolve]](promise, x)`, perform the following steps:

1. If `promise` and `x` refer to the same object, reject `promise` with a `TypeError` as the reason.
1. If `x` is a promise, adopt its state [[3.4](#notes)]:
   1. If `x` is pending, `promise` must remain pending until `x` is fulfilled or rejected.
   1. If/when `x` is fulfilled, fulfill `promise` with the same value.
   1. If/when `x` is rejected, reject `promise` with the same reason.
1. Otherwise, if `x` is an object or function,
   1. Let `then` be `x.then`. [[3.5](#notes)]
   1. If retrieving the property `x.then` results in a thrown exception `e`, reject `promise` with `e` as the reason.
   1. If `then` is a function, call it with `x` as `this`, first argument `resolvePromise`, and second argument `rejectPromise`, where:
      1. If/when `resolvePromise` is called with a value `y`, run `[[Resolve]](promise, y)`.
      1. If/when `rejectPromise` is called with a reason `r`, reject `promise` with `r`.
      1. If both `resolvePromise` and `rejectPromise` are called, or multiple calls to the same argument are made, the first call takes precedence, and any further calls are ignored.
      1. If calling `then` throws an exception `e`,
         1. If `resolvePromise` or `rejectPromise` have been called, ignore it.
         1. Otherwise, reject `promise` with `e` as the reason.
   1. If `then` is not a function, fulfill `promise` with `x`.
1. If `x` is not an object or function, fulfill `promise` with `x`.

If a promise is resolved with a thenable that participates in a circular thenable chain, such that the recursive nature of `[[Resolve]](promise, thenable)` eventually causes `[[Resolve]](promise, thenable)` to be called again, following the above algorithm will lead to infinite recursion. Implementations are encouraged, but not required, to detect such recursion and reject `promise` with an informative `TypeError` as the reason. [[3.6](#notes)]

## Notes

1. Here "platform code" means engine, environment, and promise implementation code. In practice, this requirement ensures that `onFulfilled` and `onRejected` execute asynchronously, after the event loop turn in which `then` is called, and with a fresh stack. This can be implemented with either a "macro-task" mechanism such as [`setTimeout`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#timers) or [`setImmediate`](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/setImmediate/Overview.html#processingmodel), or with a "micro-task" mechanism such as [`MutationObserver`](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-mutationobserver) or [`process.nextTick`](http://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_nexttick_callback). Since the promise implementation is considered platform code, it may itself contain a task-scheduling queue or "trampoline" in which the handlers are called.

1. That is, in strict mode `this` will be `undefined` inside of them; in sloppy mode, it will be the global object.

1. Implementations may allow `promise2 === promise1`, provided the implementation meets all requirements. Each implementation should document whether it can produce `promise2 === promise1` and under what conditions.

1. Generally, it will only be known that `x` is a true promise if it comes from the current implementation. This clause allows the use of implementation-specific means to adopt the state of known-conformant promises.

1. This procedure of first storing a reference to `x.then`, then testing that reference, and then calling that reference, avoids multiple accesses to the `x.then` property. Such precautions are important for ensuring consistency in the face of an accessor property, whose value could change between retrievals.

1. Implementations should *not* set arbitrary limits on the depth of thenable chains, and assume that beyond that arbitrary limit the recursion will be infinite. Only true cycles should lead to a `TypeError`; if an infinite chain of distinct thenables is encountered, recursing forever is the correct behavior.
